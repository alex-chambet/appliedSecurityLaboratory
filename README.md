## VM passwords
For conveniance the VM passwords are the VM name (e.g. the `ca_core` VM has password `ca_core`)

## Client VM
The Client VM has access to a password manager that contains all the useful passwords for the different user, etc. To access them you can run:
`$sudo keppassxc` in a terminal and use the `/home/client/Desktop/passwords/passwords.kdbx` database with `asl` as master key.
